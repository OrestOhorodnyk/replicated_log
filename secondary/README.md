## Secondary node
Secondary node gets messages via socets and store it in a list.
A client can get the list from the node by the REST API.
A list of REST API can be found in swagger docs by the link `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/docs`.
The potr for the secondary nodes is one of 8001 - 8004 and can be found in the docker-compose file.
